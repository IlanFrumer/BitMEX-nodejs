         *
         * This endpoint is used for placing orders. See individual fields below for more details on their use.
         *
         * #### Order Types
         *
         * All orders require a `symbol`. All other fields are optional except when otherwise specified.
         *
         * These are the valid `ordType`s:
         *
         * * **Limit**: The default order type. Specify an `orderQty` and `price`.
         * * **Market**: A traditional Market order. A Market order will execute until filled or your bankruptcy price is reached, at
         * which point it will cancel.
         * * **Stop**: A Stop Market order. Specify an `orderQty` and `stopPx`. When the `stopPx` is reached, the order will be entered
         * into the book.
         * * On sell orders, the order will trigger if the triggering price is lower than the `stopPx`. On buys, higher.
         * * Note: Stop orders do not consume margin until triggered. Be sure that the required margin is available in your
         * account so that it may trigger fully.
         * * `Close` Stops don't require an `orderQty`. See Execution Instructions below.
         * * **StopLimit**: Like a Stop Market, but enters a Limit order instead of a Market order. Specify an `orderQty`, `stopPx`,
         * and `price`.
         * * **MarketIfTouched**: Similar to a Stop, but triggers are done in the opposite direction. Useful for Take Profit orders.
         * * **LimitIfTouched**: As above; use for Take Profit Limit orders.
         *
         * #### Execution Instructions
         *
         * The following `execInst`s are supported. If using multiple, separate with a comma (e.g. `LastPrice,Close`).
         *
         * * **ParticipateDoNotInitiate**: Also known as a Post-Only order. If this order would have executed on placement,
         * it will cancel instead.
         * * **MarkPrice, LastPrice, IndexPrice**: Used by stop and if-touched orders to determine the triggering price.
         * Use only one. By default, `'MarkPrice'` is used. Also used for Pegged orders to define the value of `'LastPeg'`.
         * * **ReduceOnly**: A `'ReduceOnly'` order can only reduce your position, not increase it. If you have a `'ReduceOnly'`
         * limit order that rests in the order book while the position is reduced by other orders, then its order quantity will
         * be amended down or canceled. If there are multiple `'ReduceOnly'` orders the least aggressive will be amended first.
         * * **Close**: `'Close'` implies `'ReduceOnly'`. A `'Close'` order will cancel other active limit orders with the same side
         * and symbol if the open quantity exceeds the current position. This is useful for stops: by canceling these orders, a
         * `'Close'` Stop is ensured to have the margin required to execute, and can only execute up to the full size of your
         * position. If `orderQty` is not specified, a `'Close'` order has an `orderQty` equal to your current position's size.
         * * Note that a `Close` order without an `orderQty` requires a `side`, so that BitMEX knows if it should trigger
         * above or below the `stopPx`.
         *
         * #### Linked Orders
         *
         * [Linked Orders are deprecated as of 2018/11/10](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/deprecation-of-contingent-orders/)
         *
         * #### Trailing Stops
         *
         * You may use `pegPriceType` of `'TrailingStopPeg'` to create Trailing Stops. The pegged `stopPx` will move as the market
         * moves away from the peg, and freeze as the market moves toward it.
         *
         * To use, combine with `pegOffsetValue` to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg is set to the triggering price
         * specified in the `execInst` (default `'MarkPrice'`). Use a negative offset for stop-sell and buy-if-touched orders.
         *
         * Requires `ordType`: `'Stop', 'StopLimit', 'MarketIfTouched', 'LimitIfTouched'`.
         *
         * #### Simple Quantities
         *
         * [Simple Quantities are deprecated as of 2018/10/26](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/deprecation-of-simpleorderqty-functionality/)
         *
         * #### Rate Limits
         *
         * See the [Bulk Order Documentation](#!/Order/Order_newBulk) if you need to place multiple orders at the same time.
         * Bulk orders require fewer risk checks in the trading engine and thus are ratelimited at **1/10** the normal rate.
         *
         * You can also improve your reactivity to market movements while staying under your ratelimit by using the
         * [Amend](#!/Order/Order_amend) and [Amend Bulk](#!/Order/Order_amendBulk) endpoints. This allows you to stay
         * in the market and avoids the cancel/replace cycle.
         *
         * #### Tracking Your Orders
         *
         * If you want to keep track of order IDs yourself, set a unique `clOrdID` per order.
         * This `clOrdID` will come back as a property on the order and any related executions (including on the WebSocket),
         * and can be used to get or cancel the order. Max length is 36 characters.
         *
         * You can also change the `clOrdID` by amending an order, supplying an `origClOrdID`, and your desired new
         * ID as the `clOrdID` param, like so:
         *
         * ```
         * # Amends an order's leavesQty, and updates its clOrdID to "def-456"
         * PUT /api/v1/order {"origClOrdID": "abc-123", "clOrdID": "def-456", "leavesQty": 1000}
         * ```
         */

         *
         * Both order quantity and price can be amended. Only one `qty` field can be used to amend.
         *
         * Use the `leavesQty` field to specify how much of the order you wish to remain open. This can be useful

         * already filled.
